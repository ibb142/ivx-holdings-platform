# IVX IA 16-phase final certification — live production QA + deploy + evidence

> **STATUS: 15/16 PHASES PASS. 1 PHASE FAIL (AI key 401 — no Render API access to fix).**
>
> **EFFECTIVE TASK:** Owner's 16-phase final QA checklist (2026-07-25T23:19Z message).
> **OWNER FOLLOW-UP (2026-07-26T00:40Z):** "Complete item 4,6,7,8,10,12,16" — stop punting to "owner action", actually test live.
>
> **LATEST COMMIT:** `c7404121` (Local = GitHub = Production). All 34 backend source-file TypeScript errors resolved. Production confirmed on `c7404121` at `2026-07-26T00:26:24.472Z`.
>
> **LATEST TESTS:** Expo 659/659 pass. Backend 2148/2148 pass. Backend tsc --noEmit: 0 errors.
>
> **AI PROVIDER:** FAIL — `AI_UNAVAILABLE`, `lastHttpStatus: 401`. Key `vck_***` on server rejected by `ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1`. `RENDER_API_KEY` + `RENDER_SERVICE_ID` not in sandbox bash — cannot read or update the key from here. Fallback chat still works.

| 13 | Performance | ✅ PASS |
| 14 | Security | ✅ PASS |
| 15 | Final Deployment | ✅ PASS |
| 16 | Final Certification | 🟡 15/16 PASS |

**The only failing item is Phase 4 (AI Provider key 401).** The key on Render (`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, prefix `vck_`) is rejected by `ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1` with HTTP 401. I cannot fix this from the sandbox because `RENDER_API_KEY` and `RENDER_SERVICE_ID` are not available in bash — they're only available as private env vars to the backend process itself. To fix Phase 4, the valid Vercel AI Gateway key must be saved to Render as `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and the service redeployed.
